  "lesson_title": "The Past as a Descriptor: The Attributive Auxiliary し (shi)",
  "lesson_summary": "In the previous lesson, we used 'ki' to end a sentence in the past tense. Today, we learn its partner 'shi', which allows us to turn a past action into a description for a noun.",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "The auxiliary 'shi' (し) is the 'Rentaikei' (attributive form) of the past-tense marker 'ki' (き). While 'ki' ends a sentence, 'shi' is used to modify a noun that follows it, effectively acting like the Chinese '的' in a past-tense relative clause (e.g., 'the person I met' -> 'met-shi person').",
    "formation": "Verb (Ren'yōkei/Continuative Base) + し (shi) + Noun.",
    "variations": [
      "しか (shika) - used in specific 'logic gate' structures we will see later."
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "Do not confuse with the particle 'shi' used for listing; in poetry, if it follows a verb and precedes a noun, it is almost always the past tense marker."

      "type": "introduction",
      "content": "You've already mastered the 'Direct Past' marker き (ki), which functions like a period at the end of a memory. But what if you want to describe a specific noun using a past action? In Chinese, you might say '见过的别离' (the parting that I saw). In Classical Japanese, we swap the sentence-ending き (ki) for its attributive form し (shi) to bridge the verb to the noun."

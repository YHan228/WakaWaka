  "lesson_title": "The Logic of the 'Nu' Switch: Completion vs. Negation",
  "lesson_summary": "In this lesson, we decode the auxiliary ぬ (nu). Depending on the 'base' it attaches to, it acts either as a 'Completion' marker (it happened!) or a 'Negative' marker (it didn't!).",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "The auxiliary ぬ (nu) is a 'polymorphic' operator. Its meaning changes based on the 'base' (conjugation) of the verb it follows. 1) Perfective: Indicates an action is fully completed (like 'has done'). 2) Negative: Indicates an action does not happen (like 'does not').",
    "formation": "Perfective: [Ren'youkei (I-sound base)] + ぬ. Negative: [Mizenkei (A-sound base)] + ぬ.",
    "variations": [
      "ぬる (nuru) - Attributive form (Rentaikei) of the Perfective",
      "ね (ne) - Realized form (Izenkei) of the Perfective",
      "ぬ (nu) - Attributive form (Rentaikei) of the Negative 'zu'"
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "Perfective ぬ vs. Negative ぬ: Check the vowel sound of the verb immediately preceding it. 'A' sound = Negative; 'I' sound = Perfective."

      "content": "In previous units, we looked at how verbs describe actions. But how do we say an action is *finished* or that it *isn't happening at all*? In Classical Japanese, the syllable ぬ (nu) handles both, acting like a logical switch. To a Chinese speaker, this is like distinguishing between '了' (completion) and '不' (negation) based purely on the 'plug' used to connect the word."

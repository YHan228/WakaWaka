  "lesson_title": "The Vector of Movement: Particle へ (he/e)",
  "lesson_summary": "In this lesson, we transition from static locations to dynamic directions. You will learn how the particle へ (pronounced 'e') acts as a directional vector, pointing the way toward a destination.",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "The particle へ (written as 'he' but pronounced 'e') indicates the direction of movement. While the particle に (ni) often marks a specific destination or point in time, へ emphasizes the 'path' or 'heading' toward a place. In programming terms, if に is an assignment to a specific memory address, へ is a vector pointing toward a range.",
    "formation": "[Noun] + へ (Directional Marker)",
    "variations": [
      "へ + の: Used to describe a noun located in a certain direction (e.g., 'the garden in that direction').",
      "へ + 行く: The most common pairing, meaning 'to go toward'."
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "へ vs に: に is 'at' or 'to' (the target). へ is 'toward' (the direction). In many classical contexts, they are interchangeable, but へ feels more spatial and expansive."

In Chinese, you use '向' (xiàng) or '往' (wǎng) to show where someone is heading. In Classical Japanese, this 'vector' is handled by the particle へ."

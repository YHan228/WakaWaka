  "lesson_title": "The Persistence Flag: The Auxiliary り (ri)",
  "lesson_summary": "In this lesson, we explore the auxiliary 'ri', which indicates a state resulting from a completed action. It functions like a 'status flag' in programming, telling us that an action happened and its effect still remains in the present.",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "The auxiliary 'ri' (り) expresses the 'Resultative State' or 'Perfective'. It signifies that an action has been completed and the resulting state continues to exist. In Chinese, it is often comparable to '着' (zhe) or '了' (le) depending on whether the focus is on the ongoing state or the completion.",
    "formation": "Visually, 'ri' (or its forms 'ru'/'re') almost always attaches to a verb ending in an 'e' sound (the Izentei or Mizenkei of specific verb classes). For example: Furu (fall) becomes Fure-ru (has fallen and is now there).",
    "variations": [
      "り (ri) - Sentence-ending form",
      "る (ru) - Noun-modifying form (Rentaikei)",
      "れ (re) - Realized/Conditional form"
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "vs. たり (tari): Both indicate a resultative state. However, 'ri' is more archaic and elegant, and it only attaches to specific verb types (Yodan and Sa-hen), whereas 'tari' is more versatile."
    ]
  },
  "teaching_sequence": [
    {
      "type": "introduction",
      "content": "You have already learned 'tari' (たり) to describe a state. Today, we look at its more classical and 'strict' cousin: 'ri' (り). Think of 'ri' as a logical toggle. Once a verb is 'toggled' by 'ri', the action is finished, but the consequence is visible. If 'to fall' is the action, 'fure-ru' is the state of the snow lying on the ground."

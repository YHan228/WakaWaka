  "lesson_title": "The Logic of Isolation: Particle は (ha)",
  "lesson_summary": "Building on the basic topic marker, we explore how は (ha) functions as a 'logic gate' to isolate specific concepts, often creating a contrast between two different states or subjects.",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "In programming terms, は (ha) acts like a 'scope' or 'filter' declaration. It tells the reader: 'Regarding this specific item (and perhaps not others), the following logic applies.' When it follows another particle like に (ni), it sharpens the focus on a specific location or time.",
    "formation": "[Noun] + は | [Particle] + は",
    "variations": [
      "には (ni-ha): Specifically at/in...",
      "とは (to-ha): Specifically with/as..."
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "Unlike the subject marker (which simply identifies who does an action), は (ha) sets the stage. If you see two は in one poem, the poet is likely comparing two different things."

  "teaching_sequence": [
    {
      "type": "introduction",
      "content": "In our previous lessons, we looked at how の (no) connects nouns and に (ni) targets locations. Now, we look at は (ha) not just as a 'topic' marker, but as a tool for **contrastive logic**. Think of it as a highlighter: it isolates one part of the sentence to say, 'As for this specific thing, here is the situation,' often implying that the situation might be different for something else."

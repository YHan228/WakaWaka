  "lesson_title": "The Intentional Finish: Completing Actions with つ (tsu)",
  "lesson_summary": "Building on the concept of completion (Perfective Aspect) introduced with 'nu', we now examine 'tsu'—an auxiliary that marks the definitive end of an action, typically one involving human intent or a transitive verb.",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "The auxiliary 'tsu' (つ) indicates that an action has been completed. While 'nu' (ぬ), which you learned previously, often describes natural or spontaneous changes (like flowers falling), 'tsu' is typically used for intentional actions or transitive verbs (actions done to something). Think of it as the 'active' version of the perfective aspect.",
    "formation": "Attached to the Ren'yokei (Continuative Base) of verbs.",
    "variations": [
      "つ (tsu) - Conclusive (ends a sentence)",
      "つる (tsuru) - Attributive (modifies a noun)",
      "つれ (tsure) - Perfective (used with 'ba' for 'since/when...')"
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "vs. ぬ (nu): 'nu' is for natural/intransitive events; 'tsu' is for intentional/transitive actions.",
      "vs. particle つ (tsu): In very archaic texts, 'tsu' can be a genitive particle like 'no', but in the classical corpus, it is almost always this perfective auxiliary."
    ]

  "teaching_sequence": [
    {
      "type": "introduction",
      "content": "In the last lesson, we saw how 'nu' (ぬ) marks a state of 'having become.' However, poetry often describes deliberate actions—crying out, looking, or leaving something behind. For these 'active' completions, classical Japanese uses 'tsu' (つ). If 'nu' is a leaf falling naturally, 'tsu' is a person intentionally placing that leaf on the ground."

Because 'tsuru' is in the Rentaikei (Attributive form), it directly modifies the noun 'kata' (direction). \n\nLogic: [Crying] + [Finished] + [Direction] = 'The direction where the cry has finished/happened.' This creates a sharp temporal contrast: the sound is gone (tsu), but the moon remains."

  "lesson_title": "The Versatile Operator: Mastering the Auxiliary す (su)",
  "lesson_summary": "In this lesson, we introduce the auxiliary 'su' (す), a multi-functional 'logic driver' that attaches to the Unrealized Base (Mizenkei) to indicate causation, potential, or to transform a concept into an active process.",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "The auxiliary 'su' (す) acts like a functional wrapper in programming. It takes a verb and 'drives' it in a specific direction—either making the action happen (causative), showing respect (honorific), or enabling the action (potential). In many contexts, it simply functions as the classical ancestor of the modern verb 'suru' (to do).",
    "formation": "Attaches to the Mizenkei (未然形 - Unrealized Base) of verbs.",
    "variations": [
      "せ (se) - Mizenkei / Ren'yokei form",
      "す (su) - Shuushikei (Terminal) form",
      "する (suru) - Rentaikei (Attributive) form"
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "Do not confuse the auxiliary 'su' with the final 'su' in negative verbs like 'zu' (ず). Look for the base it attaches to: 'su' follows the Mizenkei."

      "content": "Having mastered the 'Unrealized Base' (Mizenkei) in Unit 4, you are now ready to see how it powers one of the most flexible tools in the Japanese language: the auxiliary す (su). Think of 'su' as a **logic driver**. Just as a driver can steer a car in different directions, 'su' can turn a verb into a command, a possibility, or a respectful gesture. Because you already understand Kanji, you will see that 'su' often acts as the 'grammatical engine' that puts a Kanji's meaning into motion."

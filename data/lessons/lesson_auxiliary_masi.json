  "lesson_summary": "This lesson introduces the auxiliary verb 'masi', which functions as a logical operator for counterfactual statements—expressing what would happen if reality were different than it actually is.",
  "grammar_point": "auxiliary_masi",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "The auxiliary 'masi' (まし) expresses a 'contrary-to-fact' hypothetical. It is the classical Japanese equivalent of the English 'would' in 'If I were you, I would...'. It creates a logical world that exists only in the mind, specifically contrasting with the current reality.",
    "formation": "Attaches to the Mizenkei (未然形 - Unrealized Base). This is logically consistent: since the event hasn't happened (or is the opposite of reality), it must use the 'unrealized' form.",
    "variations": [
      "ませば...まし (maseba... masi): If it were..., then it would...",
      "ましかば...まし (masikaba... masi): If it had been..., then it would have...",
      "ませ...まし (mase... masi): (Same as above, archaic)"
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "vs. む (mu): 'mu' expresses a simple future or intent (will/shall), while 'masi' specifically implies the condition is NOT true in reality."

Today, we conclude this unit by looking at the most sophisticated use of the Mizenkei: the counterfactual. In programming terms, 'masi' is like a simulation block: `if (condition == false) { result_would_be(); }`. For a Chinese speaker, think of this as the '要是...就好了' or '若...则...矣' structure, where the speaker knows the 'if' part is currently impossible."

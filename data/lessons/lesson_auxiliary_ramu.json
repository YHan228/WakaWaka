  "lesson_summary": "In this lesson, we move from speculating about the future (む) to speculating about the present. You will learn how to use the auxiliary 'ramu' to infer events happening out of sight or to explain the logical 'why' behind a situation.",
  "grammar_point": "auxiliary_ramu",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "The auxiliary らむ (ramu) is the 'Present Tense' counterpart to the む (mu) you learned previously. While む deals with the future or intent, らむ deals with the 'here and now' that the speaker cannot directly see. It functions like a logical inference engine: 'Based on what I see here, [X] must be happening elsewhere' or '[X] must be the reason why this is so.'",
    "formation": "Attached to the Shuushikei (Terminal Form) of verbs. For most verbs you've seen, this is the standard dictionary form ending in a 'u' sound.",
    "variations": [
      "Reasoning: 'That must be why...' (often paired with 'why' words or 'because' structures)",
      "Present Speculation: 'It is probably [doing] right now' (referring to a distant place)"
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "らむ (Present Inference) vs. む (Future/Will): らむ is for things happening NOW; む is for things that WILL happen.",

      "content": "In Unit 4.3, we saw how む (mu) acts as a 'probability' or 'will' tag for the future. But what if you want to guess about something happening *right now*? In classical poetry, poets often hear a sound or see a result and infer a cause. Think of らむ (ramu) as a 'Present Inference' logic gate: Input (Evidence) -> Process (Inference) -> Output (らむ)."

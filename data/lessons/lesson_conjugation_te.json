  "lesson_title": "The Logical Semicolon: Connecting Actions with て (te)",
  "lesson_summary": "In this lesson, we move beyond single-action sentences to explore how Classical Japanese links multiple verbs or states together using the conjunctive form 'te'. This functions like a logical 'and then' or a semicolon in programming, allowing for a continuous flow of imagery.",
  "grammar_point": "conjugation_te",
  "grammar_explanation": {
    "concept": "The 'te' (て) conjugation acts as a logical bridge. It suspends the sentence mid-stream, indicating that the current action is related to or followed by the next one. For a Chinese speaker, think of this as the functional equivalent of '而' (ér) or serial verb constructions where the relationship is 'Action A → Action B'.",
    "formation": "It attaches to the 'continuative' base of verbs and adjectives. While we haven't memorized conjugation tables yet, you can recognize it as the 'te' sound appearing immediately after a verb root.",
    "variations": [
      "で (de) - A voiced version used after certain verb types (similar to how some Chinese initials change in compounds)."
    ],
    "common_confusions": [
      "vs. Particle 'te': While they share an origin, focus here on 'te' as a 'logic gate' that allows the sentence to continue rather than ending."

    {
      "type": "introduction",
      "content": "Until now, we have looked at static relationships (A is B, A of B). But poetry is often a sequence of events. In programming terms, if a sentence is a line of code, 'te' is the semicolon (;) that tells the processor: 'I'm not done yet; execute this, then move to the next part.' It creates a 'flow' (ren'you) between concepts."
